## 1. Non-Conventional Usage of Memories

Non-conventional memory usage refers to the adoption of emerging memory technologies and architectures that go beyond traditional DRAM and SRAM. These include non-volatile memories (NVMs) such as Phase Change Memory (PCM), Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM), Resistive RAM (ReRAM), and Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory Modules. These technologies offer benefits like higher density, lower cost-per-bit, and lower standby power consumption compared to DRAM. However, they often have higher write latencies and lower write endurance, making them more suitable for hybrid memory systems where DRAM and NVM are combined to balance performance, cost, and energy efficiency[5][2]. Hybrid memory architectures can be flat (addressing DRAM and NVM equally) or hierarchical (using DRAM as a cache for NVM), optimizing for energy and performance by migrating data between memory types as needed[5].

## 2. Architecture of Static and D-FF Based Memories

**Static Memories (SRAM):**
- Built using cross-coupled inverters (latches) that store data as long as power is supplied.
- Commonly implemented with static flip-flops, such as D flip-flops (D-FFs), which are basic sequential logic elements that store one bit per cell.
- SRAM is fast and reliable but consumes more area and power per bit compared to dynamic memories.

**D Flip-Flop (D-FF) Based Memories:**
- D-FFs are used as basic storage elements in registers and small memory arrays.
- Architectures can use single-bit flip-flops (SBFF) or multi-bit flip-flops (MBFF) to optimize for area and power. MBFFs group several bits into a single flip-flop structure, reducing clocking power and area overhead[6].
- Static flip-flop designs, such as master-slave or transmission gate-based topologies, are optimized for low power and low latency, but may have higher setup times and sensitivity to clock signal slopes[11][9].
- SRAM and DRAM can be implemented using these flip-flop architectures, with trade-offs in speed, area, and power consumption[6].

## 3. Memory Wall

The "memory wall" describes the growing performance gap between fast processors and comparatively slower memory systems. As processor speeds have increased rapidly, memory speeds and bandwidth have not kept pace, causing processors to spend significant time waiting for data from memory. This bottleneck limits overall system performance, especially in memory-bound applications like AI, machine learning, and scientific computing[7][10][12]. The memory wall is a fundamental challenge in computer architecture, leading to innovations such as memory hierarchies (caches, DRAM, NVM) and new interconnect technologies (e.g., CXL-attached memory) to increase bandwidth and reduce latency[10][13]. Despite these efforts, the memory wall remains a key obstacle to achieving higher computational throughput in modern systems.

## 1. Non-Conventional Usage of Memories

**Good morning, everyone!**  
Let’s start by talking about memory in computers. Traditionally, we use two main types: **DRAM** (Dynamic RAM) for main memory and **SRAM** (Static RAM) for caches. But as our computing needs grow-think AI, big data, cloud computing-these conventional memories start to show limitations in speed, power, and cost.

### So, what do we mean by “non-conventional usage of memories”?

This refers to using **emerging memory technologies** or using existing memories in new ways to overcome those limitations. Some examples include:

- **Non-Volatile Memories (NVM):** These retain data even when power is off. Examples:  
  - **Phase Change Memory (PCM)**
  - **Resistive RAM (ReRAM)**
  - **Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM)**
- **Hybrid Memory Systems:** Combining DRAM with NVM. For instance, you might use DRAM as a fast cache and NVM as a large, slower main memory.
- **In-Memory Computing:** Performing calculations directly in memory to reduce data movement, which is a major source of energy consumption and delay.

**Why do we care?**  
Non-conventional memories can offer higher density, lower power, and sometimes even better performance for specific workloads. But they also come with trade-offs, like slower write speeds or limited write endurance. The challenge is to design systems that use the strengths of each memory type.

## 2. Architecture of Static and D-FF Based Memories

Let’s move on to memory architectures, focusing on **Static RAM (SRAM)** and **D Flip-Flop (D-FF) based memories**.

### **Static RAM (SRAM):**
- **Structure:** Built from cross-coupled inverters (think of them as tiny switches) that hold data as long as power is supplied.
- **Usage:** Commonly used for CPU caches because it’s very fast.
- **Pros:** Fast, doesn’t need to be refreshed.
- **Cons:** Takes up more space and uses more power per bit than DRAM.

### **D Flip-Flop (D-FF) Based Memories:**
- **What’s a D-FF?**  
  A D flip-flop is a basic digital circuit that stores a single bit of data. It “remembers” the input (D) whenever a clock signal ticks.
- **Where are they used?**  
  - **Registers:** Small, fast storage in CPUs.
  - **Register Files:** Collections of flip-flops for temporary data storage.
- **Multi-Bit Flip-Flops (MBFF):**  
  To save space and power, designers sometimes combine several bits into one flip-flop structure, reducing the number of clock signals needed.

**Key Point:**  
SRAM and D-FF memories are both “static” (don’t need refreshing), but they’re used differently: SRAM for caches, D-FFs for registers and small memory arrays.

## 3. Memory Wall

Now, let’s discuss a classic problem in computer architecture: **the Memory Wall**.

### **What is the Memory Wall?**
- **Definition:**  
  It’s the growing gap between how fast CPUs can process data and how quickly memory can supply that data.
- **Why does it happen?**  
  Processor speeds (measured in GHz) have increased much faster than memory speeds. So, CPUs often have to wait for data, which wastes their potential.

### **Why is this a problem?**
- In modern applications-think AI, graphics, and big data-programs are often limited not by how fast the CPU is, but by how quickly they can get data from memory.
- This bottleneck limits overall system performance.

### **Solutions:**
- **Memory Hierarchies:** Using multiple layers of memory (registers, caches, DRAM, NVM) to keep the most-used data close to the CPU.
- **New Interconnects:** Technologies like CXL (Compute Express Link) to improve bandwidth between CPU and memory.
- **Emerging Memories:** Using non-conventional memories as we discussed earlier.

**Takeaway:**  
The memory wall is a fundamental challenge. Overcoming it requires both new hardware (like faster or smarter memories) and clever system design.
